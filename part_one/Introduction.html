            Welcome to our experiment!
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            In this experiment, you can earn money by collecting tokens. All the tokens you earn
            during the experiment will be exchanged into money ({{ 80|cu }} = 1 EUR). In addition,
            you will receive a participation fee of 4 EUR, irrespective of your decisions. You will
            receive the earned amount after completing the experiment. Please do not communicate
            with other participants during the experiment. Your decisions and your identity will
            remain anonymous. The experiment will take approximately 45 minutes.
        </p>
            <p align="justify">
                The experiment consists of 3 parts and a final questionnaire. The computer selects in
                each part <strong>one scenario</strong> for your final payoff. The final payoff consists
                of the outcomes' sum from the selected scenarios in the First, Second and Third Part of
                the experiment. In the following, we describe the rules of the First Part.
                <strong>Please read the instructions carefully.</strong>
