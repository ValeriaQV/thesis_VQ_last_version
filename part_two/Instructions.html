            For the Second Part of the experiment, you get again an endowment of
            <strong>{{ C.ENDOWMENT }}</strong>. In addition, you will find a short text
            to read in the following page. Please, read it carefully. Thereafter, the same
            four scenarios as in Part I will be presented again, and you will be asked
            to submit your preferences.
        </p>
            <p align="justify">
                After all participants submit their answers, the computer randomly selects
                one of the scenarios from the Second Part for your payout, and you will
                learn your results from Part I and Part II.
            </p>
                <p>
                    You should always decide as if your choice will be implemented!
